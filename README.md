## Experience
Independent Research, Solar Flare Spectral Analysis–Under the guidance of Abhilash Rajendra Sarwade (Scientist- ISRO/ISITE)                 Aug 2024– ongoing
 
 • Analyzed time-resolved spectra of flares of different classes to extract temperature, emission measure, and
 elemental abundances (Fe, Ni, Ca, Ar, S) using PyXspec/XSPEC.
 • Applied deadtime correction, cross-instrument spectral fitting, and fakeit simulations to investigate abundance
 discrepancies and validate instrumental effects.
 • Corrected spectral misalignments via interpolation and correlation; tested isothermal and Gaussian DEM
 models; performed MCMC analysis with chi-squared validation and corner plot visualizations.
 • Contributed to solexs-tools and mentor’s spectral model development with testing and feedback; optimized
 integration times for enhanced spectral accuracy.
 • Integrated SDO/AIA data for multi-instrument flare evolution study; manuscript in preparation for a
 comparitive study of flares using data from Chandrayaan-2 (XSM) and Aditya-L1 (SoLEXS).
 • Tools and Skills: Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib), PyXspec/XSPEC, HEASoft, spectral modeling, MCMC,
 X-ray astrophysics, solar flare physics.
